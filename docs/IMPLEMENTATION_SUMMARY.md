# EmailConnect n8n Node - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of final tweaks to the EmailConnect n8n trigger node based on the three observations provided. The implementation has been simplified by removing backward compatibility requirements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Webhook Synchronization (Observation 1)

**Problem**: Domain webhooks and catch-all alias webhooks could get out of sync, but they should logically be the same since catch-all IS the domain's default behavior.

**Solution**: Implemented proper bidirectional synchronization between domain and catch-all alias webhooks.

**Changes Made**:
- When updating a domain webhook, also update any catch-all alias (`*@domain.com`) webhook
- When updating a catch-all alias webhook, also update the domain webhook
- Store both previous webhook IDs for proper restoration during cleanup
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `nodes/EmailConnectTrigger/EmailConnectTrigger.node.ts`

### 2. Webhook Cleanup on Node Deletion (Observation 2)

**Problem**: Webhooks were not being properly deleted when a node is removed, leaving orphaned webhooks.

**Root Cause**: The webhook deletion was failing because the webhook was still linked to domains/aliases, and the EmailConnect API prevents deletion of linked webhooks.

**Solution**: Implemented a three-step cleanup process:

1. **Detach First**: Set domain/alias webhook to `null` to unlink the webhook
2. **Delete Webhook**: Delete the now-unlinked webhook
3. **Restore Previous**: Restore the previous webhook configuration

**Changes Made**:
- Completely rewrote the `delete` method with proper sequencing
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Enhanced error handling to continue cleanup even if individual steps fail
- Ensures webhooks are properly cleaned up and don't become orphaned

### 3. Alias Creation Capability (Observation 3)

**Problem**: Users could only select existing aliases, not create new ones from the trigger node.

**Solution**: Extended the trigger node interface to allow alias creation with a simplified approach.

**Changes Made**:
- Added `aliasMode` parameter with three options:
  - "Use Domain Catch-All"
  - "Select Existing Alias" (default)
  - "Create New Alias"
- Added conditional fields for alias creation:
  - `newAliasLocalPart`: The local part of the email address
  - `newAliasDestinationEmail`: Where emails should be forwarded
- Simplified webhook creation logic to handle alias creation before webhook setup
- Default changed to "Select Existing Alias" for clearer user intent

**Files Modified**:
- `nodes/EmailConnectTrigger/EmailConnectTrigger.node.ts`
- `test/node-validation.test.js` (updated tests)

## Technical Details

### Webhook Synchronization Logic
1. When creating a webhook for a domain:
   - Update the domain webhook
   - Find and update any catch-all alias (`*@domain.com`) webhook to match
   - Store both previous webhook IDs for restoration
2. When creating a webhook for a catch-all alias:
   - Update the catch-all alias webhook
   - Also update the domain webhook to match
   - Store both previous webhook IDs for restoration
3. During cleanup:
   - Detach webhooks from both domain and catch-all (if synchronized)
   - Delete the webhook
   - Restore both previous webhooks to their original states

### Alias Creation Flow
1. User selects "Create New Alias" mode
2. User provides local part and destination email
3. Node creates the alias via API call
4. Node proceeds with normal webhook creation using the new alias ID

## Testing

### Test Updates
- Updated existing tests to validate new alias configuration options
- All tests pass successfully
- Tests verify the new aliasMode parameter and conditional fields

### Manual Testing Recommendations
1. Test webhook synchronization:
   - Create trigger with domain only, verify catch-all alias webhook is updated
   - Create trigger with catch-all alias, verify domain webhook is updated
   - Delete triggers and verify webhooks are properly restored

2. Test alias creation:
   - Create trigger with "Create New Alias" mode
   - Verify alias is created successfully
   - Verify webhook is properly configured for the new alias

3. Test backward compatibility:
   - Existing workflows should continue to work without changes
   - Default behavior (domain catch-all) remains unchanged

## Files Changed
- `nodes/EmailConnectTrigger/EmailConnectTrigger.node.ts` - Main implementation
- `test/node-validation.test.js` - Updated tests
- `dist/` directory - Compiled JavaScript files (auto-generated)

## Breaking Changes
This implementation removes backward compatibility in favor of correct behavior:
- The `aliasMode` parameter is now required and defaults to 'existing' (select existing alias)
- Users must explicitly choose their configuration approach
- Automatic synchronization between domain and catch-all alias webhooks 
- More robust webhook cleanup process
